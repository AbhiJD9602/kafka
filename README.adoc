== Running Applications with Gradle

Inside `kafka` root folder, run the following `Gradle` commands in different terminals

* *eureka-server*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :eureka-server:clean build
----

* *producer*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :producer:clean build
----

* *consumer*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :consumer:clean build
----

== Running Applications as Docker containers

=== Build Application's Docker Image

* In a terminal, make sure you are in `kafka` root folder
